ABOUT ME:
Hello! I'm Jules Andrei Romulo, a 2nd year Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) student at Laguna State Polytechnic University – Santa Cruz Campus (LSPU-SCC), under the College of Computer Studies. I’m passionate about technology, problem-solving, and continuous learning. I use this GitHub profile to document my academic journey, coding practice, and personal projects. I'm currently learning Python and SQL, and I'm exploring how to build websites using basic web development tools.
 
GOALS:
My goal as an IT student is to keep improving my skills by practicing more and trying out small projects. In the short term, I want to learn more about building full websites and understanding how the front-end and back-end work together. I also want to get better at using programming languages and understanding how software is made. In the future, I hope to explore areas like mobile app development and cloud technology, and to work on bigger projects like my capstone. Step by step, I’m working toward becoming a confident and capable IT professional.
